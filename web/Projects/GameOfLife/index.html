        Conway's Game of Life
    </h1>
    <p>
        <b>Conway's Game of Life follows four very simple rules:</b> 
        <br>
        <br> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
        2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
        <br> 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
        4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
        <br>
        <br> <b>Use "WASD" keys to move around a cursor through the grid</b> that will allow you to place cells using the "P" key.
        <br> The page <b>always generates a random pattern when it first loads.</b> You can always refresh the page to obtain a new pattern.
